### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
"My name is Shubhankar Kumar . I specialize in AI & ML algorithms and have completed a variety of projects using Python and R programming languages. My expertise includes machine learning models such as scikit-learn, Pytorch and TensorFlow, as well as deep learning models like multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks. I have applied these models to various classification and regression tasks, including natural language processing(NLP) projects using transformer models and audio datasets. Additionally, I have experience working with time series data for visualization and prediction using RNN and LSTM models.

- I hold a Master of Science degree in Mathematics and Scientific Computing from Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT) Allahabad, and I have a strong foundation in Mathematics Specially in Statistics  , Optimization , Linear Algebra , Tensor Analysis  and Graph Theory concepts. I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and approaches in the field and continually strive to enhance my skills and knowledge.

- Throughout my career, I have worked on a wide range of projects, including Human Emotion Detection : Comprehensive Deep Learning Approach , Pharmaceutical Sales Optimization Project : Market Mix Modelling a Forecating  Approach, E-Commerce Price Negotitator Chatbot and Resturant Service with Dialogflow, P&ID object detection for automation processes, resume parsing, deception detection, and data-driven agricultural development. These projects have involved the use of a variety of tools and techniques, such as Tableau, Business Analytics, MySQL, data scraping, clustering, SVM, image processing, deep learning, computer vision, PyTorch, NLP, NER, Tkinter, Flask, Spacy, Docker, word2vec, and OpenSMILE.
